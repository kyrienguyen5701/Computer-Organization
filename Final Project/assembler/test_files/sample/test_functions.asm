#   Assume 1, 2, 3, 4 are stored in memory, starting at addr 0.
#   Swap contents of array given *indices* to be swapped
#   Register use:
#	$1: base addr of array arr (assume arr starts at mem addr 0)
#	$2: 1st index to swap
#	$3: 2nd index to swap
#	$4: true addr of index $2
#	$5: true addr of index $3
#	$6:	contents of arr[$2]
#	$7: contents of arr[$3]
#	Passes if array contains 2, 1, 4, 3 in that order
